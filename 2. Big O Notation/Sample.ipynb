    "## How to Calculate Time Complexity of Code \n",
    "---\n",
    "Calculating the time complexity of a piece of code involves understanding how the execution time grows as the size of the input (`n`) increases. We use Big O notation to express this growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identify the Input Size\n",
    "First, identify what your input is. For example, if you have a function that sorts a list of numbers, `n` would be the length of that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Identify Basic Operations\n",
    "Look at the code and identify the basic operations that are executed repeatedly or based on the input size (`n`). Common operations include loops, function calls, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Count the Dominant Operations\n",
    "Focus on the operations that grow the fastest as `n` increases. For example, a loop that runs `n` times will have a different impact on time complexity compared to a loop that runs `n^2` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Express the Complexity with Big O Notation\n",
    "Once you've identified the dominant operations, express how the execution time grows relative to `n`. Use Big O notation to describe the upper bound of this growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let's say we want to calculate the time complexity of a function that finds the maximum element in a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_max(numbers):\n",
    "    max_num = numbers[0]  # O(1)\n",
    "    for num in numbers:   # O(n)\n",
    "        if num > max_num:  # O(1)\n",
    "            max_num = num  # O(1)\n",
    "    return max_num\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Identify Input Size (n): Here, n is the length of the list numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify Basic Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assigning max_num = numbers[0] (constant time operation, O(1)).\n",
    "* Looping through the list numbers (O(n) because it scales linearly with the input size).\n",
    "* Comparing each number and updating max_num if necessary (constant time operations inside the loop, O(1)).\n",
    "* Count the Dominant Operations: The loop (for num in numbers:) is the dominant operation because it scales directly with n.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Express the Complexity with Big O: Combining these, the time complexity of find_max is O(n), indicating that the execution time of this function grows linearly with the size of the input list.**\n",

    "## Calculating Time Complexity for Recursive Functions\n",
    "---\n",
    "Recursive functions are functions that call themselves. Calculating their time complexity involves understanding how many times the function gets called and what work is done in each call.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identify the Recursive Function\n",
    "\n",
    "First, identify the recursive function for which you want to calculate the time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Define the Recurrence Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the recurrence relation that describes how the function calls itself. This relation represents the time complexity of the function in terms of smaller inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the recurrence relation to find the time complexity of the recursive function. This might involve using techniques like substitution, recursion tree, or master theorem depending on the form of the recurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the Fibonacci sequence calculation as a recursive function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Identify the Recursive Function (fibonacci): This function calculates the Fibonacci number recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the Recurrence Relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrence relation for fibonacci(n) is:\n",
    "T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1) (for the addition operation)\n",
    "Solve the Recurrence Relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the Fibonacci function can be derived as O(2^n) using methods like recursion tree or mathematical induction. This reflects the exponential growth of function calls with respect to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "- Recursive functions can have different forms of recurrence relations based on how they divide the problem and combine the results.\n",
    "- Analyzing recursive time complexity often involves understanding the number of recursive calls made and the work done per call.\n",
