    "### Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the element that is inserted first is the one that is removed first. Imagine a queue of people waiting in line; the person who joins the line first will be the first to be served or attended to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-life Example:\n",
    "An everyday example of a queue is a line of people waiting at a ticket counter. The person who arrives first gets the ticket first and leaves, followed by the next person in line, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Front and Rear in Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "In a queue data structure, \"front\" and \"rear\" are terms used to denote specific positions within the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Front**: The front of the queue refers to the position where elements are dequeued or removed. When you dequeue an element, you are taking it from the front of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rear**: The rear of the queue represents the position where new elements are enqueued or added. When you enqueue an element, you are adding it to the rear of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a queue with elements `[10, 20, 30, 40]` where:\n",
    "- `10` is at the front of the queue.\n",
    "- `40` is at the rear of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queue looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Front -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> Rear\n",
    "```\n",
    "* From the above example, you can see that the front of the queue is at the leftmost position, and the rear is at the rightmost position.\n",
    "* From the front of the queue, elements are dequeued, and at the rear, elements are enqueued.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Queues:\n",
    "1. **Linear Queue**: In this basic type, elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).\n",
    "2. **Circular Queue**: A variant of the linear queue where the last element points back to the first element, creating a circular structure. This helps in efficient memory utilization and allows continuous use of the queue without resetting.\n",
    "3. **Priority Queue**: Elements have a priority associated with them, and the element with the highest (or lowest) priority is dequeued first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations on Queue:\n",
    "1. Enqueue (Insertion)\n",
    "    - **Description**: Adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue.\n",
    "    - **Graphical Representation**:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        enqueue(5)\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> Rear\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dequeue (Deletion)\n",
    "    - **Description**: Removes an element from the front of the queue.\n",
    "    - **Graphical Representation**:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        dequeue()\n",
    "        Front -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Front\n",
    "    - **Description**: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.\n",
    "    - **Graphical Representation**:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        front() => 1\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rear\n",
    "    - **Description**: Returns the element at the rear of the queue without removing it.\n",
    "    - **Graphical Representation**:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        rear() => 4\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. isEmpty\n",
    "    - **Description**: Checks if the queue is empty.\n",
    "    - **Graphical Representation**:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        isEmpty() => False\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "6. isFull\n",
    "    - **Description**: Checks if the queue is full.\n",
    "    - **Graphical Representation**:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        Front -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> Rear\n",
    "        isFull() => False\n",

    "The `collections` module in Python provides a `deque` (double-ended queue) which can efficiently implement a queue with O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations from both ends.\n",
