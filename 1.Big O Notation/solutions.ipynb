    "   - Here, the dominant term in the time complexity expression is 'n'.\n",

    "3. **O(2n)**:\n",
    "   - The constant multiplier '2' in O(2n) does not change the order of growth; it remains linear with respect to 'n'. \n",

    "   - Nevertheless, when we talk about big O notation, we focus on the highest order term for complexity comparisons. \n",
    "   - Hence, O(n + nlogn) simplifies to O(nlogn), not equivalent to O(n).\n",
