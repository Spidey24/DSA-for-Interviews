    "### Stack \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates on the principle of Last In, First Out (LIFO). This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates where you can only add or remove the topmost plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Example: Stack of Plates\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a stack of plates in a cafeteria. Plates are stacked one on top of another. When you need a plate, you naturally take the top one. Similarly, when you finish using a plate, you place it on the top of the stack. This arrangement ensures that the last plate you added (the topmost one) is the first to be taken or used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uses of Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are used extensively in computer science and software development for various purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function Call Stack:** When a function is called, its local variables and the return address are pushed onto a stack. When the function completes, this information is popped off the stack.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are used to evaluate and convert infix expressions (like `3 + 4 * 5`) to postfix notation (`3 4 5 * +`), which is easier to evaluate using a stack-based algorithm.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Undo Mechanisms:** Many applications use stacks to implement undo functionality. Each action that modifies the state is pushed onto the stack, allowing users to reverse the changes sequentially.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Backtracking:** In algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), stacks are used to keep track of the nodes to explore, enabling backtracking to previous nodes when necessary.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Parsing:** Stacks play a crucial role in parsing algorithms, such as checking balanced parentheses or tags in HTML/XML documents.\n",

    "#### Stack Operations and Graphical Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Push (Add to Stack)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `push` operation adds an element to the top of the stack. The newly added element becomes the topmost element in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical Representation:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Before Push         After Push (5)      \n",

    "| 1 | 2 | 3 | | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |\n",
    "+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+\n",
    "↑ Top: 5 added\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pop (Remove from Stack)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pop` operation removes the topmost element from the stack. It returns the removed element and updates the stack's top position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical Representation:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Before Pop         After Pop\n",

    "+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+\n",
    "↑ Top: 3 removed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Peek (Get Top Element)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `peek` operation returns the topmost element from the stack without removing it. It allows you to access the top element without modifying the stack.\n",

    "+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+\n",
    "↑ Top: 3 returned\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. isEmpty (Check if Stack is Empty)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `isEmpty` operation checks if the stack is empty. It returns `true` if the stack is empty and `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
