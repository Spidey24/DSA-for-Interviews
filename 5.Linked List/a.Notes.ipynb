    "### Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements called nodes. Each node contains two parts: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, they use pointers (or references) to link nodes together, forming a chain-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-life Example of Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a linked list in real life could be a train. Each train car represents a node in the linked list. The car contains cargo (data) and is connected to the next car using a coupling (link/reference). The sequence of connected train cars forms a linked list, allowing for flexible arrangement and removal of cars without needing contiguous storage space like an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminologies Associated with Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the common terminologies used when discussing linked lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node**:\n",
    "   - Each element in a linked list is called a node. It consists of two parts: data (the value or payload) and a pointer/reference to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Head**:\n",
    "   - The head is the first node of the linked list. It is the entry point for accessing the list and holds the reference to the first node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tail**:\n",
    "   - The tail is the last node of the linked list. It is the node whose next pointer is NULL, indicating the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Next Pointer**:\n",
    "   - Each node (except the last one) contains a next pointer/reference that points to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Previous Pointer (Doubly Linked List)**:\n",
    "   - In a doubly linked list, each node has a previous pointer that points to the previous node in addition to the next pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Empty List**:\n",
    "   - An empty list is a linked list with no nodes. The head typically points to NULL in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications of Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists find applications in various domains due to their flexibility and efficient insertion/deletion operations. Here are some common applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Linked lists are used in dynamic memory allocation systems like malloc() in C. They allow for efficient memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implementing Stacks and Queues**: Linked lists are often used to implement stack and queue data structures due to their ability to easily add and remove elements from either end.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Music Player Playlist**: In a music player, a playlist can be implemented using a linked list where each song is a node pointing to the next song in the playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hash Table Chaining**: Linked lists are used in hash table implementations with chaining. Each bucket in the hash table can point to a linked list of elements that hash to the same bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Graphs**: Linked lists are used to represent adjacency lists in graph implementations. Each vertex has a linked list of adjacent vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **File Systems**: Linked lists are used in file systems to maintain the list of disk blocks that make up a file. Each block points to the next block in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Garbage Collection**: Linked lists are used internally in garbage collection algorithms to maintain the list of unused memory blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LRU Cache**: Linked lists can be used in implementing the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache, where recently accessed elements are moved to the front of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Undo Functionality**: Some applications use linked lists to implement undo functionality. Each operation can be stored as a node in a linked list, allowing for easy reversal of actions.\n",

    "#### Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists can vary in structure and functionality to suit different needs. Here are some common types of linked lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Singly Linked List**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Doubly Linked List**\n",
    "\n",
    "A doubly linked list contains nodes with two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node. This allows bidirectional traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Head <-> Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 <-> ... <-> Null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Circular Linked List**\n",
    "\n",
